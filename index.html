<p>The Mixtapes are an award-winning a cappella group from New York University, known for their show stopping performances and impressive music arranging acumen. They have won many ICCA titles, and received their most recent accolades at the 2018 Semifinals, where their unique set was awarded “Outstanding Arrangement.”

From Beyonce to The Beatles, Stevie Wonder to The Script, YEBBA to Brayton Bowman, and so many more, The Mixtapes’ repertoire includes a wide variety of genres and influences. They never stop testing the limits of a cappella music. Whether they are incorporating non-Western musical styles that reflect the diversity of the group itself, or finding creative ways to use the human voice, The Mixtapes remain at the forefront of a cappella innovation.

Besides being sincerely committed to their musicianship, The Mixtapes are a fiercely loyal family whose passion for music shines through in every note. The care they give each other is the same care they put into their performances and recorded music. When you listen to The Mixtapes, there is no question that they love what they do!
